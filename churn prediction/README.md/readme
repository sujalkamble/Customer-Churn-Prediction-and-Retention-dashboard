Customer Churn Prediction + Retention Dashboard (Power BI + ML)

This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company and provides a Power BI dashboard for visualizing churn risk 
and retention strategies. By combining machine learning with interactive dashboards, it enables businesses to identify high-risk customers, optimize retention campaigns, and reduce revenue loss due to churn.

The project includes a complete ML pipeline that handles data preprocessing, trains an XGBoost classifier, evaluates performance, 
and exports predictions in a format ready for Power BI visualization. This empowers business users to make data-driven decisions efficiently.


Requirements :

The project requires the following tools and libraries:
Python 3.12
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical computations
Scikit-learn – Preprocessing, pipeline, and evaluation
XGBoost – Churn prediction classifier
Joblib – Model persistence
Power BI Desktop – Dashboard visualization
